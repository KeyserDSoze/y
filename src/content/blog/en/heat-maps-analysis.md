# Player Heat Maps: How to Interpret Movement Data

Heat maps represent a fundamental tool in modern football analysis, allowing visualization of player movements and positions during matches.

## What is a Heat Map

A heat map is a visual representation that shows:
- **Zones of highest presence**: Where the player spends most time
- **Movement density**: Activity intensity in each field area
- **Tactical patterns**: Recurring positioning schemes

## Color Interpretation

### Standard Color Scale
- **Intense red**: Maximum presence/activity
- **Orange**: High presence
- **Yellow**: Medium presence
- **Green**: Low presence
- **Blue**: Minimum presence

## Practical Applications

### Defensive Analysis
- Identification of uncovered zones
- Pressing evaluation
- Defensive line analysis

### Offensive Analysis
- Penalty area movements
- Space creation
- Attack effectiveness

## Case Study: Modern Midfielder

Analysis of a top midfielder shows:
- Concentration in the central third of the field
- Extension towards both flanks
- Significant presence in the opponent's area

This data helps understand the tactical evolution of the role.
